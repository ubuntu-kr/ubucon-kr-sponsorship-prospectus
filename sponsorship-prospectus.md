# About Ubuntu & UbuCon Korea

**Ubuntu**, co-developed by the Ubuntu Community with people from worldwide and Canonical, stands as the world's leading open-source Linux-based operating system. While Ubuntu started as an easy-to-use Linux desktop 20 years ago, today, with its mission to bring free software to the widest audience while accelerating innovation and underpinning operations, Ubuntu powers millions of devices from personal computers to cloud infrastructure, serving as the foundation for technological advancement in AI, cloud computing, IoT, and enterprise solutions.

Today, there are **two major annual events** that bring together people from the global Ubuntu community to share various projects and practices in the Ubuntu ecosystem: **UbuCon**(s) across different regions and the **Ubuntu Summit.**

The main difference between the two events is that Canonical, the creator of Ubuntu, is largely involved with organizing the Ubuntu Summit, while UbuCon is a community-driven event that is **solely organized by the community.** These UbuCons are held in **different regions within a continent or country,** and today there are UbuCon NA @ SCaLE, UbuCon Europe, UbuCon Latin America, UbuCon Portugal, and UbuCon Asia.

**UbuCon Korea** is the largest domestic Ubuntu community event of the year, bringing together contributors and users of Ubuntu projects in Korea, and was started as a spin-off of UbuCon Asia 2022, which was the first in-person event in Seoul. Following successes of our previous editions on last 2 years at Microsoft Korea with 151 participants, UbuCon Korea 2025 will be held on August 9 at the same venue with diverse programs to celebrate 20 years of Ubuntu Korea Community!

- **Name:** UbuCon Korea 2025
- **Date:** August 9th, 2025

- **Scale:** 150+ participants (Including speakers and staff)

# About Ubuntu Korea Community

## About the community
Started in 2005, the Ubuntu Korea Community is a place for Korean Ubuntu users and contributors, and is also an official Ubuntu local community verified by the Ubuntu Local Community Council. To expand the popularity of Ubuntu and related open sources in Korea, the community operates forums for Ubuntu-related Q&A, translates various Ubuntu packages into Korean, runs a Korean Ubuntu wiki, and works on documentation. We also hold various offline events such as general meetings, regular seminars, workshops, group study activities, and UbuCon for offline exchanges among community members.

## Activities to expand Ubuntu adoption and improve usability
Our online forum, which has been with the community since its beginning, is still live and has recently been revamped with Discourse to make it more user-friendly. Multilingual support for the various packages available in Ubuntu is maintained by local communities in each country. Our community also has a translation team, which continues to contribute to Korean support for Ubuntu. When necessary, we translate documents of interest to many people, such as Ubuntu release notes, into Korean, making it easier for people who are not familiar with English to access information about Ubuntu.

## Host a variety of in-person events
In addition to online-based activities such as running online forums and contributing to Ubuntu projects. We periodically organize offline events for community members to meet and interact. These events include regular general meetings (within three months after closing finances each year), regular seminars, hands-on workshop events, group study activities, and the annual UbuCon, a large-scale event that brings together Ubuntu users and contributors from various fields.

## Engaging with international communities
We continue to interact with various overseas Ubuntu and open source communities, including Ubuntu Japan, Ubuntu Taiwan, Ubuntu Malaysia, Ubuntu Indonesia, Debian Japan, FOSS Nepal, Ubuntu India and FOSSASIA, and we also participate in UbuCon Asia, the premier event for Ubuntu community exchange in Asia, where we share our activities with each community.
